Welcome to CPSC453 Assignment 1!


Student Name: James Donald Thorne
Student ID:   10018506


Target Platform:
   This assignment has been tested to run on the computers in MS239.


Compiling and Running:
   To compile and run this assignment, go to the assignment folder and type:

   $ make
   $ ./assignment1


How to Use the Assignment:
   To use this assignment, perform the following steps:
   - Select an image by clicking on the "File" menu, then clicking on an image name.
   - Select an operation by clicking on the "Operation" menu, then clicking on an operation name.
   - Specify the amount of the operation, by clicking anywhere on the "Amount" slider.  The
     original image appears on the left, and the filtered image appears on the right.

   - Optionally, save the image by clicking "Save Filtered Image" from the "File" menu.


Implemented Requirements:
   I have implemented ALL of the functional requirements listed in the assignment 
   description, including all of the bonus ones.  All features are available from
   the "Operation" menu at the bottom of the main window.

   I have also implemented scale, rotate, bilinear scale, and swirl as variable filters, 
   instead of simply fixed ones.

   For completeness, the implemented requirements are listed below:

   Implemented Required Operations:
   - Quantize   (levels 2 - 255)
   - Brighten   (scale factors 0.0 - 2.0)
   - Saturation (scale factors 0.0 - 2.0)
   - scale      (supports scale factors from 0.0 - 2.0)
   - Rotate     (supports rotations from 0 - 180 degrees)

   Implemented Required Interface:
   - A popup menu to load the image(s), and save the resulting image
   - A popup menu to select the desired operation
   - A slider control to adjust the parameter
   - Both images are visible at the same time.

   Implemented Bonus Features:
   - Contrast        (scale factors 0.0 - 2.0)
   - Bilinear scale  (supports scale factors from 0.0 - 2.0)
   - Swirl           (supports angles from 0 - 180 degrees)
   - Dissolve        (supports parametric distance 0.0 - 1.0)


Reused Code:
   This assignment is entirely my own work, except for the following items:

   - RgbImage.h / RgbImage.cpp, created by Samuel R. Buss, used as a requirement of this assignment.
