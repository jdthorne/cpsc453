Welcome to CPSC453 Assignment 3!


Student Name: James Donald Thorne
Student ID:   10018506


Target Platform:
   This assignment has been tested to run on the computers in MS239.


Compiling and Running:
   To compile and run this assignment, go to the assignment folder and type:

   $ make
   $ ./assignment3


Brief User Manual:
   To use this assignment, run the application, select a scene, and click "Render".
   The scene will be rendered, and displayed in the window as it is completed.  

   Once the render is complete, you can optionally save it by clicking "Save Image".


   You can also create additional scenes by creating and editing ".scene" files.  Please
   take a look at the included sample files for reference; the file format is generally:

      ObjectType: Property = Value, Property = Value, Property = Value

   Possible objects are:

      Triangle: P1 = [x], [y], [z]; P2 = [x], [y], [z]; P3 = [x], [y], [z]; Material = [material]
      Quad: P1 = [x], [y], [z]; P2 = [x], [y], [z]; P3 = [x], [y], [z]; P4 = [x], [y], [z]; Material = [material]
      Light: Position = [x], [y], [z]; Color = [r], [g], [b]
      Cylinder: Position = [x], [y], [z]; Normal = [x], [y], [z]; Height = [h]; Radius = [r]; Material = [material]
      Sphere: Position = [x], [y], [z]; Radius = [r]; Material = [material]


Data-Structures Used:
   Color
      This structure represents a rgb color, with three color channels (r, g, b) stored as
      double-precision floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0.

   Ray
      The Ray structure represents a single ray being traced.  It consists of a start point
      (represented by a vector), and a direction (represented by a unit vector).

   RayIntersection
      The RayIntersection structure represents a ray intersecting with an object.  This structure
      holds the incoming ray, intersection point, surface normal, and material at the intersection
      point.  It also provides several convenience functions, e.g. reflectedRay().

   PossibleRayIntersection
      This structure allows us to represent either an intersection, or a lack of intersection,
      without having to deal with null pointers.

   Vector
      This structure represents a simple three-dimensional vector.  The vector is stored as
      three discrete double values, 'x', 'y' and 'z'.

   Group
      A "group" is a collection of objects, that can be treated as a single object.  This allows
      us to glue e.g. multiple triangles together into a single mesh.

   SceneObject (and Sphere, Cylinder, Triangle, Quad)
      Various objects, each of which are responsible for calculating ray intersections,
      knowing their material, and knowing their dimensions.

   Scene
      A scene is a top-level group, which also includes lights, and functionality to read itself
      in from a file.

   PropertyList
      PropertyList is a simple structure which allows easy parsing of definition strings like
      "Property = Value, Property2 = Value".

   QList
      Provided by Qt, QList<> is a templated data structure which stores elements in either
      an array of pointers or an array of items, depending on the item's size.

      More information is available in the Qt documentation:
      http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.7/qlist.html

   QMap
      Provided by Qt, QMap<> is a templated data structure that stores elements in a 
      skip-list based dictionary.  It is used primarily to store calculated normals of
      vertices and faces.

      More information is available in the Qt documentation:
      http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.7/qmap.html


Algorithms Used
   Ray-Sphere Intersection
      Intersection between rays and spheres are calculated by equating the ray equation and
      the sphere equation, and then solving for the ray distance parameter t.

   Ray-Cylinder Intersection 
      Similar to ray-sphere intersection, this algorithm equates the ray equation and the
      cylinder equation.

   Ray-Triangle Intersection
      This is a two-step algorithm, first using the plane equation to determine where an
      intersection exists, and then using the area solving technique to determine if the
      intersection point is within the triangle.

   Phong Lighting and Shadows
      Surface colors are calculated by casting a ray to each light.
      - If the ray intersects an object first, it's in shadow, and only ambient light is used
      - If the ray reaches the light, then diffuse and specular lighting is calculated using
        the Phong lighting equations
   Shadows, Reflections, etc


Implemented Requirements:
   I have implemented all of the required functional requirements listed in the assignment 
   description, as well as several bonus ones.


   The requirements I have implemented are listed below:

   I have also implemented several bonus requirements:

   - Scene and light specification read from input file              see ".scene" files
   - Refraction (recursive)                                          refraction.png
   - Cylinder primitive (only when aligned along the y-axis)         cylinders.png


Reused Code:
   This assignment is entirely my own work, except for the following items:

   - Vector.cxx and Vector.h, reused and enhanced from my Assignment 2 submission.

   Note that I did NOT use the provided GraphicsGems code to implement cylinders;
   I implemented them entirely on my own to maximize the learning opportunity.
